 <div style="background-color:#808080; text-align:center; vertical-align: center; padding:40px 100px;">  My twenties and thirties were some of the best years of my life. I spent my time hanging out and living with my absolute best friends, having not a care in the world. We spent a lot of our free time at Central Perk in The Village. It was our #1 hangout spot. Everyday, sitting on that same ugly orange couch, what I wouldn't give to go back. Our weekends consisted of random adventures, vacations, and just figuring out how we could get out of whatever predicament we managed to get in. </div>

<P>

<P> Sitting in our usual seats in Central Perk, drinking coffee, and whining about the events in our lives.</P>

<P> Let's just say, Miami Vice was very popular while Ross and I were in college. And I am ashamed there is photo evidence of it. </P>

<P> Rachel and I eating the leftovers of the cheesecake we stole from our elderly neighbor. I wish I could say that it's not as bad as it sounds, but it's not, it's worse. </P>

<P> How my wife had a Halloween costume as great as Cat Woman and I ended up as a pink fluffy bunny, I have no idea. </P>
<IMG SRC="date.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Computer Hope">
<P> This was during the time Monica and I were still keeping our relationship a secret. I had to go on a date with Phoebe to prove I was single, let's just say it didn't go well. </P>
<IMG SRC="canoe.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Computer Hope">
<P> Joey voluntarily was trapped in our entertainment center, and we were robbed of all of our furniture. We spend a long time watching TV from the canoe in the middle of our living room.</P>
<IMG SRC="wax.gif" width="600" height="400" alt="Computer Hope"> 
<P> Being trapped in Monica's bedroom for hours on end while Ross and Rachel were breaking up in the next room was a desperate time. Wax was the only semi food-like substance, so we had no choice but to survive on eating it. </P>

<P> Just a casual snuggle session. </P>
