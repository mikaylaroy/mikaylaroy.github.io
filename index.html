 <P> Hi, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! </P>
 <P> Many of you may know me from the hit TV show Friends. I currently work in advertising at BARKER Advertising NYC. I live in Westchester county with my wife Monica, and twins, Erica and Jack. In my free time I enjoy visiting Central Perk in The Village to have coffee with my old friends. Feel free to explore my page to learn more about My Younger Years, My Friends, and to take a look at My Photo Gallery! </P>
